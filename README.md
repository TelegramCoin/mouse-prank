# Mouse Prank
A little python script to move the cursor in a random direction every few seconds.
It's a hidden launcd agent, so it's hard to find!

# Install
- Run the install.sh script.
- Wait for your victim to reboot or login

*It's only working on OSX*

# Uninstall
To remove it, delete joker.plist, MouseTools and pyScript.sh from ~/Library/LaunchAgents


Use on your own risk
